            I completed my studies at the Vocational High School of Korydallos, specializing in Information Technology Applications.
            During this time, I learned HTML, CSS, object-oriented programming with Python, and the basics of databases.

            After finishing school and earning my certification, I continued my education
            with a post-secondary apprenticeship year to advance my qualifications with a higher-level diploma. 
            In this program, I further developed my skills by learning JavaScript, WordPress,
            PHP, and MySQL.
            </p> 
            
            <p>I also worked on improving my knowledge through self-study, online tutorials,
            and hands-on practice. This helped me strengthen my frontend development skills, particularly in React.js,
            which I now use in my projects.
